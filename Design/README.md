## Development Lifecycle

### Resources
- [SDL (Secure Development Lifecycle) by Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/practices)
  - Provide Training:
    - Developers, engineers and even managers must understand security basics
    - They must know how to build security into software and services
    - effective training will help:
      - Security Policies
      - SDL Practices
      - Standards
      - Requirements of Software Security
    - Everyone:
      - `does not have to` be a hacker or security expert
      - `must` understand attacker's perspective and its goal
  - Define Security Requirements
    - `Security & Privacy` is a fundamental aspect of developing highly secure applications & systems
    - Security requirements must be `continually` updated
    - Changes must be identified and threat landscape must be updated based on changes
    - Best Time to Define Security Requirements:
      - Initial Design
      - Planing Stages
    - Factors That Influence Security Requirements
      - Legal Requirements
      - Industry Requirements
      - Internal Standards
      - Coding Practices
      - Review of Previous Incidents
      - Review of Known Threats
    - Security Requirements must be tracked by:
      - either work-tracking system
      - or telemetry derived from engineering pipeline
