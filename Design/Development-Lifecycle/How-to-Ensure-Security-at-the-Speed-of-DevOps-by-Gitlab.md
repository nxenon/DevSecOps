# [How to ensure security at the speed of DevOps by Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/10/31/speed-security-devops/)

## Overview:
Choosing between security and speed is sometimes hard. Teams often do not have security in their pipelines and deployments, because security checks are manual. But you can make have security in the beginning of SDLC.

### 1. Make Small, Frequent Changes
   - run automated tests on small chunks of code to identify security issues faster
   - developers can fix these small chunks of code easier than a fixing a big change
### 2. Educate Developers and Security Teams
   -  Create or adopt educational program with these goals:
      - teach developers to recognize common vulnerabilities and remediate on their own
      - security professionals should understand development technology
### 3. Fail Fast, Fix Fast
   - If automated scan find security vulnerabilities, developers should respond fast
### 4. Prioritize Risks
   - Risks have different level of priorities
   - DevOps and Security team must define security guidelines that allows team to prioritize risks
   - Risks with high priority must be fixed in the short term
### 5. Automate as Much as Possible
   - Manual security tests cannot keep up
   - There are many tasks (technologies, deployments &...), so that security teams cannot perform these tasks manually
   - Tests must be pre-written
   - Policies must be pre-defined
### 6. More Is Better
   - Testing more frequently is better
   - In rapid development, teams have small changes, and small fixes
   - Vulnerabilities can be found in these small changes easier

## 🗝️ Conclusion -> Like Always, Communication is the Key
- Security and DevOps teams must co-operate and be on the same page
- Leaders must push the members to work together and understand each team goals
- Every business should focus on building a security-first mindset
- Make it easy with integrated or single tools
