# ‚ôæÔ∏è DevSecOps
DevSecOps **Taken Notes** from articles `in addition to` resources for DevSecOps.

# üìù Notes & Resources
Some links are resources and some links are notes which have been manually taken. Names which have `+` at the beginning, are taken notes.

## ü™ú Design / Plan
**Design** / **Plan** Phase Actions:
- `Threat Models` & `Security Requirements` should be designed and defined
- `Risks` & `Plans` for preventing threats from happening should be identified

## üßë‚Äçüíª Develop
**Develop** Phase Actions:
- `Secure Coding`
- `Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)`: Can be integrated into developers environment (Find security issues in code)
  - when developer is actively coding (e.g. a SAST IDE Plugin)

## ‚öíÔ∏è Build
**Build** Phase Actions:
- `Static Application Security Testing (SAST)`: Find security issues in **code**
- `Software Composition Analysis (SCA)` & `Software Bill of Material (SBOM)`: Find components and compare them against a database like National Vulnerability Database
- `Secret Management`: Find **Secrets**
- `Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)`: Test in an automated way and find vulnerabilities faster in run-time
