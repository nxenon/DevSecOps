# DevSecOps
DevSecOps **Taken Notes** from articles `in addition to` resources for DevSecOps.

# Design / Plan
In **Design** / **Plan** Phase:
- Threat Models & Security Requirements should be designed and defined
- Risks & Plans for preventing threats from happening should be identified

## Notes:
- Development Lifecycle
  - [SDL (Security Development Lifecycle) by Microsoft](./Design/Development-Lifecycle/SDL-by-Microsoft.md)
  - [How to Ensure Security at the Speed of DevSecOps by Gitlab](./Design/Development-Lifecycle/How-to-Ensure-Security-at-the-Speed-of-DevOps-by-Gitlab.md)
- Threat Model
  - [Threat Modeling by OWASP](./Design/Threat-Model/Threat-Modeling-by-OWASP.md)
  - [Structured Threat Modeling Process by OWASP](./Design/Threat-Model/Threat-Modeling-Process-By-OWASP.md)

# Develop
In **Develop** Phase:
- Secure Coding should be determined
- Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) can be integrated into developers environment
  - when developer is actively coding (e.g. a SAST IDE Plugin)

## Notes
- Secure Coding
  - [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](./Develop/Secure-Coding/OWASP-Secure-Coding-Practices.md)
- SAST in Developer's Environment
  - TODO
