Software composition analysis is your best bet for finding vulnerabilities 
in open source packages and learning how to fix them,
empowering you to secure your code and the health of your applications.

## What Is Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA) is an application security methodology for managing open source components
- Using SCA, development teams can `quickly` track and analyze any open-source component into a project
- SCA tools can discover:
  - related components
  - their supporting libraries
  - direct and indirect dependencies
- SCA tools can also detect:
  - software licenses
  - deprecated dependencies
  - vulnerabilities and potential exploits
- The scanning process generates a Bill of Material (BOM), providing a complete inventory of a project's software assets
- SCA requires to be `developer first`

## Why Use a Software Composition Analysis Tool?
Open source components are becoming major building blocks in software across practically every vertical.
SCA tools help keeping track of open source components used by your applications,
which is critical both from a productivity and a security standpoint.
