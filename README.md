# ‚ôæÔ∏è DevSecOps
DevSecOps **Taken Notes** from articles `in addition to` resources for DevSecOps.

# üìù Notes & Resources
Some links are resources and some links are notes which have been manually taken. Names which have `+` at the beginning, are taken notes.

## ü™ú Design / Plan
In **Design** / **Plan** Phase:
- `Threat Models` & `Security Requirements` should be designed and defined
- `Risks` & `Plans` for preventing threats from happening should be identified


### Development Lifecycle
- [+ SDL (Security Development Lifecycle) by Microsoft](./Design/Development-Lifecycle/SDL-by-Microsoft.md)
- [+ How to Ensure Security at the Speed of DevSecOps by Gitlab](./Design/Development-Lifecycle/How-to-Ensure-Security-at-the-Speed-of-DevOps-by-Gitlab.md)
### Threat Model
- [+ Threat Modeling by OWASP](./Design/Threat-Model/Threat-Modeling-by-OWASP.md)
- [+ Structured Threat Modeling Process by OWASP](./Design/Threat-Model/Threat-Modeling-Process-By-OWASP.md)

## üßë‚Äçüíª Develop
In **Develop** Phase:
- `Secure Coding` should be determined
- `Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)` can be integrated into developers environment
  - when developer is actively coding (e.g. a SAST IDE Plugin)

# ‚öíÔ∏è Build
In **Build** Phase:
  - `Static Application Security Testing (SAST)` should be used to find security issues in code
  - `Software Composition Analysis (SCA)` & `Software Bill of Material (SBOM)` should be done to find components and compare them against a database like National Vulnerability Database
  - `Secret Management` should be implemented to find **Secrets** in code
  - `Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)` should be performed to test in an automated way and find vulnerabilities faster in run-time
